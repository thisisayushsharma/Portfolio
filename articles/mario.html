            <p>I wrote this game using Phaser js. This framework helps to make browser game by 
                dealing with all the mathematical component of the game like when collisions occur and how to
                provide gravity in the game. For example,we can just set the gravity to a value in the config and that sets the gravity to that value
                for our game.     
            </p>
            <p>
              All the classes in my program extends Phaser.Scene. The preload class loads all the assets of the game in the program.
              Then it invokes the main class. In that class, I have create and update functions. The create function loads all the
              required assets needed in the game. It is in update function, where we tell the character to move right if right key is pressed,
              left if left key is pressed and jump is up arrow is pressed. It is in this function that tells the game to
              behave certain way when collided with something, or which sound to play if player jumps.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a lot of pre built phaser functions like .staticGroup that makes the object static which means
                it will not be affected by gravity or anything and will stay in the same place througout the game. I also used 
                .setScrollFactor fucntion to create a parralax background. In this game, you will notice that the sky doesnot move,
                the building move but very slowly and the platforms move faster. All this was done with the help of .setScrollFactor function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the game is finised or if you die, I used delayedCall function and restart function to restart the game 
                not immediately but after sending a message to the player.
